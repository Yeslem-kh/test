# Project Setup and Pipeline Execution Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Amazing Project**! We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your support in assisting us with the project setup. This guide will provide clear instructions on how to configure and execute the pipeline efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, please ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. **Public URL Setup**  
   This URL will be generated by running the `start_ngrok.sh` script.

2. **GitLab Environment Variables**  
   You need to configure the following GitLab environment variables:
   - **`$ZAP_PROXY_URL`**: This variable should contain the public URL exported by the `start_ngrok.sh` script.
   - **`$SONAR_HOST_URL`**: This variable should contain the public URL for SonarQube, which is generated using **Cloudflared**.

3. **SonarQube API Configuration**  
   The SonarQube configuration must be properly set up, including the correct **Sonar API URL** (`$SONAR_HOST_URL/api`) and the necessary **SonarQube token**.

4. **OWASP ZAP Configuration**  
   The OWASP ZAP proxy should be running on the same machine. To do this, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   /usr/share/zaproxy/zap.sh -daemon -port 8090 -host 0.0.0.0 -config api.disablekey=true
